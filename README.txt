Welcome to the Course Goal App !!!

The general ideea behind this app is to have a way to manage a list of goals.
As functionalities go, you can add a new goal from the input present in the single page app.
The goal that you added is saved in a list bellow the form.
You can also delete the goal from that list by pressing the "Remove Goal" button.

The app was developed in React with the help of HTML5 & CSS3.

The purpose behind this app is to just save my daily course goals.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you enjoy !!!
